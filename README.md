## Project Overview
This project leverages ***data analysis*** and ***machine learning*** to develop a ***recommendation system*** for rental properties in Boston, specifically designed for students at Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT). The system aims to address the challenges of Bostonâ€™s ***competitive rental market*** by providing actionable insights into ***affordable***, ***accessible***, and ***user-preferred*** housing options.

By integrating ***rental price data***, ***property characteristics***, and ***travel time metrics***, this project tackles critical issues such as high demand and limited affordable options near universities. The objective is to identify properties that ***balance cost and convenience***, simplify the ***decision-making process***, and utilize ***data-driven approaches*** to deliver personalized recommendations, ultimately enhancing housing choices for students.
